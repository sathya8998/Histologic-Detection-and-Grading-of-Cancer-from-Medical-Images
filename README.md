# Histologic Detection and Grading of Breast Cancer (IDC)

## Overview
This repository implements a deep learning pipeline for detecting and grading **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)** in breast cancer histopathology images. IDC, comprising ~80% of breast cancer cases, originates in milk ducts and can spread to surrounding tissues. Early detection via whole-slide images (WSI) is critical for high survival rates. The project combines:

- **CNN (VGG16)**: Classifies 50x50 image patches as benign or malignant using transfer learning.
- **Gradient Traversal**: Traverses from random seed pixels to cancer regions (ROI) using Sobel filters for gradient magnitude/orientation.
- **Mask SLIC**: Identifies cancer ROIs via supervoxel segmentation.
- **BiLSTM**: Classifies directional paths (N, S, E, W) for enhanced grading, combining with CNN outputs.
